# MonLearning
code and data for machine learning on monomial ideals



Placeholder for now.

In dissertation, I promised this would be the location of:
* neural network model in keras/TF
* directory containing all training data
* LearnHilbert.m2 for Hilbert series stuff, pivot rules
* MonLearning.m2 for various random models, invariants, writing data directories
