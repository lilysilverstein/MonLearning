# MonLearning
code and data for machine learning on monomial ideals

Future home of:
* *MonLearning.py*: Keras/TensorFlow code defining the neural network architecture and implementing training and testing routines.
* *TrainingData/*: A directory containing the complete training data, organized into subdirectories corresponding to the families of monomial ideals described in Chapter 7.
* *HilbertML.m2*: Macaulay2 code implementing flexible pivot rule choices for Hilbert series computations, counting base cases, etc.
* *IdealML.m2*: Miscellaneous M2 code for generating random monomial ideals of various kinds, computing invariants, file I/O and organization for training data, etc.
